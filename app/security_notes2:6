netcat, see open ports on machine:
	nc <ip addr> 80, nc <ip addr> 22 (ssh)
	nc -v -n -z -w1 <ip addr> [port range]
better way, nmap
	nmap <ip addr>
	to get software:
		-A (os version detection)
		-P (skip host discovery)
	nmap -A -P0 <ip addr>
SecLists (password cracking, brute force)

172.16.122.132, break into this (lab 4)

osx logs: cd /var/log
	nmap will leave log files, you'll get caught
	np, w/ root priveleges, you can delete logs

tcpdump -i eth0 -w nmap.pcap (-w, write to file)
